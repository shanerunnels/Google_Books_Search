# React Google Books Search

### Overview

React-based Google Books Search app. This SPA (Single Page Application) uses [`react-router-dom`]to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express. Using helper/util functions and React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches, this is a full MERN stack application allows users to save books to a database to refer to at a later date. Built with Node, Express and MongoDB, and React-Toastify for custom alerts. Toasty!

### required npm packages

`mongoose`, `axios`, `react-router-dom`, `react-toastify`

## Database

1. Connect to a MongoDB database named `googlebooks` using the mongoose npm package.

2. Using mongoose, create a Book schema.

3. Books should have each of the following fields:

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

* Example JSON:

    ```js
    {
      authors: ["Suzanne Collins"]
      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."
